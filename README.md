Ajax Browscap
=============
Add browser data to the &lt;html&gt; tag using the data returned from the Browscap module and Ajax.

In the admin section, you can choose which properties you would like to send from Browscap to the JSON output. You can choose whether to include the default js file which will add the classes or roll your own using the `/ajax-browscap` path.
